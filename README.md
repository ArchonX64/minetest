A little fun project where I try to create a Minecraft-like sandbox game from scratch, using minimal dependencies!

Dependencies used:
- WGPU: For cross-compatible rendering
- cgmath: For common mathematical and graphical calculations
- Legion: For entity-component-system capability (making an efficient ECS system is a lot, and detracts from the game aspect)
- AB-Glyph: For loading fonts
